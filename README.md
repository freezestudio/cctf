# The C++ Compile time Test Framework

The `C`++ `C`ompile time `T`est `F`ramework(CCTF) is a test suite used in c++ compile time.

We usually use a lot of runtime test libraries, such as googletest, boost.test, and so on. C++ supports compile-time calculations. We usually use the facilities provided by the STL library or provide our own examples to run compile-time calculations. But I didn't find a test framework that could run at compile time. Perhaps this framework would not have been needed.
However, I want to implement or integrate a test framework that is suitable for C++ compile time. It's just a test.
